## Bickley-Jet

This is one of the first rust programs I developed to create an array for the cross-stream flow, $u(y)$, of the Gulf Stream if treated as a Bickley Jet:

$$u(y) = u_o\sec^2{y/L}$$

where $u$ is the along-stream flow, $y$ is the cross-stream coordinate, and $L$ is the half-width scale of the Gulf Stream set here to 50 km.
